Object oriented programming --> 
Solving a problem by creating object is one of the most popular approaches in
programming. This is called object-oriented programming.

Object Information:
Objects of  a given class can invoke the methods available to it 
without revelaing the implementation detailed to the user. --> Abtraction and Encapsulation


Class Attributes:
an attribute that belongs to the class rather than a particular object.



#Self Parameter:
self refers to the instance of the class. It automatically passed with a function call
from an object.

#Static method:
sometimes we need a function that does not use the self-perimeter. We can define a 
static method like this:
    @staticmethod   #decorator to mark greet as a static method
    def greet():
        print("Hello user)

#__INIT__() constructor:
__init() is a special method which is first run as soon as the object is created..
__init__() method is also known as constructor..
-->It takes self-argument and can also take further arguments.
